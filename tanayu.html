    <section class="plain-text">
        <h1>What is a Tanayu?</h1>
        <p>
            The term Tanayu comes from the words <em>tana</em> and <em>layu</em>, which in Classical Anta mean <em>earth</em> and <em>to live</em> respectively. They are scientifically known as <em>Thalassogigantia insularis</em> and share a genus with the smaller Pygmy Tanayu, <em>Thalassogigantia isletus</em>, and the thought-extinct, much bigger Elder Tanayu, <em>Thalassogigantia continentalis</em>.
            <br>They are colossal, millennial, marine creatures that reach staggering sizes of up to <strong>ten kilometers of lengths and four kilometers across</strong>. While most of their body mass is submerged underwater, their backs project out and provide close to <strong>sixteen square kilometers</strong> of solid land with <strong>heights of up to five hundred meters</strong> in some points. This, combined with the nature of their carapace and the ecosystems that live atop them, makes them look like islands from afar. Islands of white soil and red vegetation.
        </p>
        <h1>The carapace</h1>
        <p>
            On their backs there is a carapace constructed from a continuous, solidified calcareous secretion known as <em><strong>albasoil</strong></em>. This substance is continuously produced throughout their lives and serves as their waste disposal mechanism, which makes it abundant in nutrients. 
            <br>With the carapace exposed, it undergoes erosion from the winds and the rains and breaks into sand-sized grains. This creates two layers to the carapace: the <em><strong>solid albasoil</strong></em> layer at the bottom, and the <em><strong>soft albasoil</strong></em> layer that rests on top of it.
            <br>The Tanayu have some degree of control over the secretion process. They have millions of pores covering their entire backs and they can strategically deposit albasoil in areas where it is more needed or it will be integrated the best into the layers of the carapace.
            Moreover, if no albasoil is needed in the carapace at a certain time, they can dispose of waste through lateral pores that will eject the albasoil into the ocean. This allows for the distribution of nutrients to other marine ecosystems that can benefit from it.
            <br>Finally, at a certain age, they will slow down the production so as to prevent the uncontrolled accumulation of albasoil.
        </p>
        <h1>Sources of energy and their management</h1>
        <p>
            A creature of this size and magnitude requires an enormous amount of energy to sustain itself. And so, it harvests this energy from different sources and adapts its lifestyle to make the most of it.
            <br>They float on the surface and propel themselves along while filter feeding with their beak. This is their primary source of energy. Earlier in the evolutionary line, they fed on WIP, plankton-like organisms that live In the uppermost layers of the ocean in search of sunlight. This is still true for Tanayu offspring that are still small in size. However, adult specimens can consume fish and any other animal that may cross their path as the species has now reached colossal proportions.
            <br>Its secondary source of energy comes from a symbiotic relationship that it forms with organisms called <em><strong>tadpole algae</strong></em>, or <em><strong>talgae</strong></em>. These talgae attach themselves to the carapace of Tanayu offspring when they still swim underwater and, once they display their backs above the surface, they transition to life out of the water and grow to be a myriad of organisms reminiscent of earth’s trees and plants, expanding like a clonal grove. These talgae make use of the nutrients present in the albasoil. In exchange, they provide a portion of the energy that they produce through photosynthesis to the Tanayu via an intricate network of roots.
            <br>To save on energy, the Tanayu are not always on the move. They make stops along their cyclic migratory path where they will stay completely put and recharge through photosynthesis for a couple of days or weeks before resuming their journey.
        </p>
        <h1>Lifecycle</h1>
        <h2>Tanalet stage</h2>
        <p>
            The life of a Tanayu starts on the breeding grounds, a place on the planet where all the Tanayu meet to reproduce. They are hermaphrodite so all of them lay and fertilize eggs. 
            <br>The eggs take only a couple of weeks to hatch and when the offspring is born they are the size of a human hand. At this stage, the Tanayu offspring are called <em>tanalets</em>.
            <br>The hatched tanalets swim up to who they think is their mother, often just finding the closest adult to them. They will follow the adult and hide under them for protection for the rest of this first stage of their lives.
            <br>Any Tanayu that did not acquire offspring of their own will keep following their mother and try to get lucky when the next breeding season comes around.
            <br>It is during this stage that tadpole algae will attach themselves to the forming carapace and will wait for it to come out of the water. Since it can’t rely on photosynthetic energy, the tanalet will have to compete with its siblings to feed on whatever WIP(plankton-like organisms) is left by their mother. WIP(plankton-like organisms) is still the only reliable source of food due to their small size.
            <br>This competition, combined with the dangers that are posed by predators, means that only a small portion of the tanalets survive to become tanalings. Out of a litter of thousands, only about three to five survive. The survival rate, however, is increased through human intervention.
        </p>
        <h2>Tanaling stage</h2>
        <p>
            Once a tanalet has grown to be <strong>an eighth</strong> of its mother’s size, after approximately <strong>fifty years</strong>, it will swim to the surface and project its back out of the sea. It will have survived to become a <em>tanaling</em>.
            <br>At this stage, the tadpole algae will transition to life out of the water and will expand through the carapace like a clonal grove as the tanaling grows in size. This means that the tanaling will have access to the photosynthetic energy supplied by its talgae friends. Moreover, thanks to their new size, they will now be able to consume bigger organisms like fish and such.
            <br>During this stage, the tanaling will follow its mother along her migratory path and act as any other adult. The only thing holding it back from becoming an adult itself is the lack of any offspring to tend to. The tanaling will feed on anything it can find as it awaits the next breeding season. The bigger it gets, the more likely it is for it to get some tanalets to nurture when the time comes. 
            <br>Since it will swim behind its mother with the rest of its siblings, there is still a bit of competition for the adult’s leftovers. Thisoften results in archipelagos, a group of tanayu, forming a V shape like that of migrating birds. This ensures that each tanaling covers a different part of the ocean and everyone gets food.
        </p>
        <h2>Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
            Once <strong>a hundred</strong> years have gone by since the last mating season, all of the Tanayu will meet at the breeding grounds again. If a tanaling successfully acquires some tanalets to tend to, it will have reached its adult stage. Once everyone leaves, it will part on its own migratory path. Competition for these paths is fierce and it will have to be quick and smart. Some tanalings forge friendships and will swim alongside one another.
            <br>Human intervention at this stage makes it so many tanaling never reach their adult stage. More on this when we talk about <a href="archipelagos.html">archipelago societies</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
            When a Tanayu dies after some millenia, their corpse will float about for a while until it finally sinks. If the Tanayu that died was an adult in charge of an archipelago, there are two possible scenarios for the future thereof.
            <br>If there are still some tanalets under the tanayu’s protection, they will swim to the closest tanaling. The tanalings that get some tanalets to tend to will swim away and start their own adult life. The ones who don’t will choose one of their siblings to follow. To avoid their nation splitting apart, humans artificially move or guide the tanalets to a tanaling of their choice that will serve as their new main tanayu.
            <br>If there are no tanalets under the tanayu’s protection, the oldest tanaling will assume the role of an adult and their siblings will follow until they get offspring to tend to like they normally would.
