            <h1>Yhizago: the call of the tanayu</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Nero 3D2Y, also known as Yhizago /'waɪ.zə.goʊ/, a planet completely covered by water. It blossoms with alien flora and fauna, including some sentient species that have constructed advanced civilizations. <br>
                In this blue planet, there is one creature that seems to be completely out of place. They call themselves human. They live atop giant colossal marine creatures and man-made structures built in the most shallow areas. Whatever their origin might be, they have integrated themselves in this world. They have established relations with the other inhabitants of this planet and are now a core part of its history. <br>
                This is a world building project that includes constructed languages, speculative biology, politics, history, conflicts, and much more.
